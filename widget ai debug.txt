Analyzing file
Based on the file content you provided, this code is a compiled Vue component named Clock.vue. It's part of a larger application, likely built with Vue.js and bundled with Webpack.

This specific code file doesn't directly contain the logic for the clock widget's functionality. Instead, it appears to be the output of the Webpack build process, specifically for the template part of the Clock.vue component. It imports the generated render and staticRenderFns from another module (identified by the long path starting with ./node_modules/.pnpm/).

To find the exact path on your system to the script that makes the system widgets function, you would typically need to locate the source code files before they are processed by Webpack.

Here's how you might approach this:

Identify the project root: Look for the main directory of the casaos-main project on your system. This is usually where the package.json and Webpack configuration files are located.
Navigate to the source directory: Within the project root, there's likely a src directory. This is where the application's source code, including Vue components, is usually stored.
Locate the widgets directory: Inside the src directory, look for a directory related to "widgets". Based on the webpack://casaos-main/src/widgets/Clock.vue path, a widgets directory is highly probable.
Find the Clock component file: Within the widgets directory, you should find the Clock.vue file. This file will contain the template, script, and style sections of the Vue component.
The script section within the Clock.vue file (or potentially in a separate .js or .ts file imported by Clock.vue) will contain the JavaScript code responsible for the clock's functionality (fetching the time, updating the display, etc.).

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the exact path on your system because I do not have access to your local file structure. However, by following the steps above within the casaos-main project directory on your computer, you should be able to locate the relevant source file(s).

Framework: Vue.js
Technologies: Webpack, Babel, Vue Loader
Patterns: Component-based architecture (Vue)

what is the sync^\.\ folder that these *.vue scripts are within?

AI
Analyzing file
I can't determine the exact name of the folder from the provided code snippet. The Clock.vue file is located within the src/widgets directory in the original project structure before being processed by Webpack, as indicated by the webpack://casaos-main/src/widgets/Clock.vue path.

However, the term "\_sync\_" followed by a period (._) is not a standard naming convention for folders in typical web development projects, especially within the context of Vue.js or Webpack. It's possible this refers to:

A specific build or deployment process unique to this project that creates temporary or synchronized folders.
A misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the file structure.
A dynamically generated or temporary directory not present in the source code repository.
If you are seeing a folder with a name like _sync_ followed by a period in your file system, it's likely not the original source code directory. The original .vue files for the widgets should be located within the src/widgets directory in your casaos-main project's source code.

does this vue file contain script to sync the mapped vue files with another server?

AI
Analyzing file
No, this _sync_nonrecursive_.vue$ file does not contain script to sync the mapped Vue files with another server.

This file is a Webpack context module. It's generated by Webpack when it encounters a dynamic import or require.context that needs to include all files matching a certain pattern (in this case, .vue files within the src/widgets directory non-recursively).

Its primary function is to:

Create a map that links the original file paths (like "./Clock.vue") to their corresponding internal Webpack module IDs.
Provide a webpackContext function that allows other parts of the bundled application to synchronously load these mapped modules using their original paths.
The term "sync" in the filename and the webpackContext.id ("./src/widgets sync .vue$") refers to synchronous module loading within the Webpack bundle itself, meaning the modules are included directly in the bundle and can be accessed immediately. It has no relation to synchronizing files with an external server.

In essence, this file is a tool created by Webpack to manage the loading of specific Vue component files within the bundled application, enabling dynamic import functionality.

i am attempting to use another local SSH ai to build a battery widget to integrate with this particular portion of the casaos system, similar to the Clock.vue, Disks.vue, etc. we are having trouble locating the correct pathing that defines these widgets to build one, and set one. can you provide the most critical summarized details to help?

AI
Analyzing file
Based on the main.js file and the context from the previous Clock.vue and _sync_nonrecursive_.vue$ files, here's a summary of the critical details for integrating a new battery widget into this CasaOS system:

1. Project Structure and Key Directories:

The application uses Vue.js as its frontend framework.
Source code for the main application is likely within the src directory.
Widgets, including Clock, CPU, Disks, and Network, are located in the src/widgets directory. This is the directory where you should place your new battery widget file (Battery.vue).
2. Widget File Type and Structure:

Widgets are implemented as single-file Vue components (.vue files).
A .vue file typically contains three main sections:
<template>: HTML structure for the widget's visual representation.
<script>: JavaScript code for the widget's logic, data, methods, and interactions.
<style>: CSS for styling the widget.
3. Widget Discovery and Loading:

Webpack is used to bundle the application.
The _sync_nonrecursive_.vue$ file acts as a Webpack context module for the src/widgets directory. This means that Vue files placed in src/widgets are made available for dynamic loading within the application.
To make your Battery.vue widget discoverable, you just need to place it in the src/widgets directory. Webpack will automatically include it in the context module.
4. Core Application Entry Point:

The main.js file is the application's entry point. It initializes Vue, sets up the router, store, and various plugins.
It imports the main App.vue component, which likely serves as the main layout or container for the application, including where widgets are displayed.
The main.js file also imports various libraries and services:
vue: The Vue.js framework.
@/App.vue: The root Vue component.
@/router: Vue Router for handling navigation.
@/store: Vuex store for state management.
@/plugins/i18n: Internationalization plugin.
@/service/api.js and @/service/index.js: Likely handle API calls and backend communication. Your battery widget will likely need to interact with these services to get battery status data.
buefy: A UI component library based on Bulma. You might use its components for your widget's UI.
vue-socket-io-extended: Suggests the application uses WebSockets for real-time updates. This is a crucial detail. Your battery widget might need to subscribe to WebSocket events to get live battery status changes.
Other imported libraries provide various functionalities like touch events, social sharing, DOM purifying, and animations.
5. Interacting with the System:

To get battery status information, your Battery.vue component will need to interact with the backend services. Look at how other widgets (like CPU or Disks) fetch their data using the imported @/service modules.
Given the use of vue-socket-io-extended, there's a strong possibility that battery status updates are pushed from the backend via WebSockets. Your widget should ideally listen for relevant WebSocket events to update in real-time.
In summary, to build and integrate your battery widget:

Create a Battery.vue file in the src/widgets directory.
Implement the UI in the <template> section.
Write the logic in the <script> section to:
Fetch initial battery status using the provided @/service modules (likely an API call).
Listen for WebSocket events for real-time battery updates.
Manage the widget's state (e.g., battery percentage, charging status) in its data properties.
Style the widget in the <style> section.
The main App.vue or a related component is where the widgets are displayed. You'll need to modify that component to include your Battery.vue component. This might involve adding it to a list of dynamic components or explicitly including it in the template.
By focusing on the src/widgets directory for placing your file and understanding the role of main.js and the imported services for data fetching and real-time updates, you should be able to integrate your battery widget effectively.
